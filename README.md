Data Challenge
==============

The questions below are designed to test your proficiency with data tasks. They are intended to get progressively more difficult.

## Question 1

A source emails you a file with the extension **CSV**. What program would you use to open the file?

## Question 2

The yearly batting averages for Derek Jeter and David Justice are given by this table:

| Year | Derek Jeter | David Justice |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1995 | .250        | .253          |
| 1996 | .314        | .321          |
| 1997 | .291        | .329          |

Which player had the highest cumulative batting average from 1995 through 1997?

## Question 3

According to the American Community Survey's 5-year estimates for 2013, which county in the U.S. had the highest percentage of homes worth $1,000,000 or more?

## Question 4

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an online filing system called EDGAR. Data about those filings can be accessed via the agency's FTP site. How many filings did the agency receive in the second quarter of 2010?

## Question 5

Download the file called [manyfiles.zip](data/manyfiles.zip?raw=true) from this repository and extract it on your local machine. Inside are a large number of files, each of which contains a number. Tally up all the numbers: What is the total?

## Question 6 (Extra Credit!)

This repository contains a dataset called [bonus.csv](data/bonus.csv?raw=true) with seven simulated variables, **V1** through **V7**.

Briefly describe in words or images how the first variable (**V1**) interacts with the remaining six variables (**V2** through **V7**).
