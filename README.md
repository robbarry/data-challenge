Data Challenge
==============

The questions below are designed to test your proficiency with data tasks. They are intended to increase in difficult as you progress.

## Question 1

A source emails you a file with the extension **CSV**. What program would you use to open the file?

## Question 2

The yearly batting averages for Derek Jeter and David Justice are given by this table:

| Year | Derek Jeter | David Justice |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1995 | .250        | .253          |
| 1996 | .314        | .321          |
| 1997 | .288        | .293          |

Which player had the highest cumulative batting average from 1995 through 1997?

## Question 3

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an online filing system called EDGAR. Data about those filings can be accessed via the agency's FTP site. How many filings did the agency receive in the second quarter of 2010?

## Question 4

Download the file called [question4.zip](data/question4.zip) from this repository and extract it on your local machine. Inside are a sequence of files, each of which contains a number. Iterate through all these files and add up the numbers they contain. What does it equal?

## Question 5 (Extra Credit!)

This repository contains a dataset called [bonus.csv](data/bonus.csv) with seven simulated variables, **V1** through **V7**.

Briefly describe in words or images how the first variable (**V1**) interacts with the remaining six variables (**V2** through **V7**).
